## EDA and ML Projects
Repository contains the various projects with code written in Python and R Language for-
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, k-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, SVM, Desicion Tree, Random Forest, Time-Series Analysis, XgBoost)

Below are the list of some common Packages/Libraries which were used as a part of the data analyis and building Machine learning model
* **Data Manipulation:** 
  - **R ::** dplyr, plyr, tidyr, stringr, data.table, lubridate(for date manipulation)
  - **Python ::** Pandas
* **Data Visualization:** 
  - **R ::** ggplot2, cowplot, ggthemes, scales
  - **Python ::** matplotlib, seaborn
* **ML models:** 
  - **R ::** randomForest, caret(for Data splitting, cross validation, Pre-processing, Feature selection, Variable importance estimation, etc.)
  - **Python ::** scikit-learn
* **Recommendation model:** recommenderlab
* **Text Mining:** 
  - **R ::** tm, tidyverse
  - **Python ::** nltk, spaCy
