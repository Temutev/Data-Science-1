## EDA and ML Projects
Repository contains the various projects with code written in R Language for-
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, k-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, SVM, Desicion Tree, Random Forest, Time-Series Analysis, XGBoost)

Below are the list of some common Packages/Libraries which were used as a part of the data analyis and building Machine learning model
* **Data Manipulation:** dplyr, plyr, tidyr, stringr, data.table, lubridate(for date manipulation),
* **Data Visualization:** ggplot2, cowplot, ggthemes, scales
* **ML models:** randomForest, caret(for Data splitting, cross validation, Pre-processing, Feature selection, Variable importance estimation, etc.)
* **Recommendation model:** recommenderlab
* **Text Mining:** tm, tidyverse
