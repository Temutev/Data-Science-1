## Problem Statement
Customer segmentation for targeted marketing is one of the most vital applications of the clustering algorithm. Here, as a manager of the online store, you would want to group the customers into different clusters, so that you can make a customised marketing campaign for each of the group. You do not have any label in mind, such as good customer or bad customer. You want to just look at patterns in customer data and then try and find segments. This is where clustering techniques can help you with segmenting the customers. Clustering techniques use the raw data to form clusters based on common factors among various data points. This is exactly what will also be done in segmentation, where various people or products will be grouped together on the basis of similarities and differences between them.

As a manager, you would have to decide what the important business criteria are on which you would want to segregate the customers. So, you would need a method or an algorithm that itself decides which customers to group together based on this criteria.
